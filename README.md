# Movie-Tracker
Developed an website which helps us to find the details of the movie using movie name.
#### This website has been developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I had used the API from the Omdb API website.
The output gives the details of the respetive movie as follows;
        i) Title:
       ii) Rating:
      iii) Director:
       iv) Released Date:
        v) Genre:
        
 This is how an output is shown to the users.
